Hi! If you're seeing this it mean it's your first time launching 'Match my Shader'

This game was created in just 10 days for a game jam called Timeless, where the goal was to build a game that someone could enjoy for the next 10 years.

In Match My Shader, your challenge is to write (Python) code that draws a shader to match a target pixel-perfect result. It's creative, puzzling, and endlessly replayable.

There is two gamemodes:
- Freeplay, where you just code for fun or drawing things
- Challenge, where you have to match a target (as said about)
